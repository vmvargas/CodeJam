    <h2>Approach #1</h2>
    <p>If this were a binary search tree, we could do a modified find on the two nodes and see where the paths diverge.
    <p>Unfortunately, this is not a binary search tree, so we must try other approaches.</p>
    <p><strong>Attempt #1:</strong> If each node has a link to its parent, we could trace p and q’s paths up until they intersect.</p>
    <p><strong>Attempt #2:</strong> Alternatively, you could follow a chain in which p and q are on the same side. That is, if p and q are both on the left of the node, branch left to look for the common ancestor.</p>
    <p>When p and q are no longer on the same side, you must have found the first common ancestor.</p>

<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
public Tree commonAncestor(Tree root, Tree p, Tree q) {
    if (covers(root.left, p) && covers(root.left, q))
        return commonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    if (covers(root.right, p) && covers(root.right, q))
        return commonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    return root;
}
private boolean covers(Tree root, Tree p) { /* is p a child of root? */
    if (root == null) return false;
    if (root == p) return true;
    return covers(root.left, p) || covers(root.right, p);
}

    <h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>What is the running time of this algorithm? One way of looking at this is to see how many times each node is touched.
            Covers touches every child node, so we know that every single node in the tree must be touched at least once, and many nodes are touched multiple times.</p>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Attempt #3:</strong> For any node r, we know the following:
    <ol>
        <li>1. If p is on one side and q is on the other, r is the !rst common ancestor.</li>
        <li>2. Else, the first common ancestor is on the left or the right side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, we can create a simple recursive algorithm called search that calls search(left side) and search(right side) looking at how many nodes (p or q) are placed from the left side and from the right side of the current node.</p>

    <p>If there are two nodes on one of the sides, then we have to check if the child node on this side is p or q (because in this case the current node is the common ancestor).</p>

    <p>If the child node is neither p nor q, we should continue to search further (starting from the child).</p>

    <p>If one of the searched nodes (p or q) is located on the right side of the current node, then the other node is located on the other side. Thus the current node is the common ancestor.</p>
